    "aboutme":`
    I have a wealth of experience as a developer with over 15 years of development history in various software areas.
    I have built full stack web frontend and backend applications using web programming languages such as PHP, Javascript, Python and Ruby. My web application development was started with PHP and thus I have rich experience in Various PHP Frameworks, such as Laravel, Codeigniter, CakePHP, Yii, etc.
    I have considerable experience and knowledge in content management systems such as Wordpress, Shopify, Joomla, Magento and squarespace.

    My development aim is to build fully responsive websites for professionals and small-medium sized businesses. My projects are well-structured, a code is very clean and easy-to-maintain, easy-to-understand. I can always understand clearly how to bring your idea to life. So I like to share my knowledge through Reddit, Medium, Github, Gitlab, StackOverflow, Codepen, etc.
    I am very familiar to do teamwork through remote project management tool (Trello, Jira, etc) and software version management tools (Git, SVN, etc). And I am always trying to improve my skill and learn new technologies.

    If you give me opportunity, this would be our one another successful project, so I would be really grateful if you could give me this opportunity.
    Looking forward to working with you in a long-term relationship. Best Regard!!!
    Serkan
